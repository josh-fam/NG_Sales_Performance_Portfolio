# NG_Sales_Performance_Portfolio

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Nigerian sales data to identify trends by state, channel, and time.  
It demonstrates data cleaning, validation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Repository Structure
- `data/raw/` → Original dataset (`ng_messy_sales.csv`)
- `data/cleaned/` → Cleaned dataset (`ng_sales_cleaned.csv`)
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter Notebook for analysis
- `README.md` → Project documentation
- `requirements.txt` → Python dependencies

## Steps
1. Clean messy raw data (remove nulls, convert data types).
2. Validate totals (`Calculated Sale` vs `Total Sale`).
3. Perform analysis:
   - State performance
   - Channel performance
   - Time-based sales
4. Export cleaned dataset.

## Results
- Highlight top-performing states.
- Identify most effective sales channels.
- Reveal seasonality and sales trends.
